Feature: Customer Management
    As a system administrator
    I want to be able to manage customers
    So that I can add, edit, and delete customer records

    Scenario: Adding a new customer
        Given I am on the customer management page
#        When I click on "Add New"
#        And I fill in "First Name" with "John"
#        And I fill in "Last Name" with "Doe"
#        And I fill in "Email" with "john.doe@example.com"
#        And I fill in "Phone Number" with "123456789"
#        And I fill in "Bank Account Number" with "1234567890"
#        And I select "2024-05-08" as the "Date Of Birth"
#        And I click on "Add"
#        Then I should see "John Doe" in the list of customers
#
#    Scenario: Editing an existing customer
#        Given I am on the customer management page
#        When I click on "Edit" next to the customer "John Doe"
#        And I change the "First Name" to "Jane"
#        And I click on "Save"
#        Then I should see "Jane Doe" in the list of customers
#
#    Scenario: Deleting an existing customer
#        Given I am on the customer management page
#        When I click on "Delete" next to the customer "Jane Doe"
#        And I confirm the deletion
